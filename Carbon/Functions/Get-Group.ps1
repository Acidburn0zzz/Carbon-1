function Get-CGroup

    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets *local* groups.

    .DESCRIPTION
    `Get-CGroup` gets all *local* groups or a specific group by its name.

    The objects returned, `DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.GroupPrincipal`, use external resources, which means they don't clean up propertly when garbage collected, resulting in memory leaks. You should call `Dispose()` on the objects you receieve from this function when you're done using them so these external resources can be cleaned up correctly.

    `Get-CGroup` is new in Carbon 2.0.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.GroupPrincipal.
